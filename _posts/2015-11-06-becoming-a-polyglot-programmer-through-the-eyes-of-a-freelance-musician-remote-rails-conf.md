Before coming to the software world, I was a freelance musician for over 10+ years. I toured and played bass with bands and artists like Albert Lee, Ray Parker, Jr. of Ghostbusters fame, and even was featured on Entertainment Tonight. As a developer now, I look back on some of the concepts I learned to become a successful musician and how they apply to learning software. Truthfully, they are not that different.

Lets dive into how the world of music has attempted to overcome a lot of the challenges around learning a new coding language, and see if we can draw some parallels together.
