I have started working with Ruby on Rails as of January of this year. It was tough to decide how I wanted to focus, but after trying ruby, was sold.

I fell in love with ruby quickly. The syntax is so friendly and easy to use. I enjoy when I find that it “makes sense” and am surprised how often it works “just like you would guess."

Additionally, the Ruby community is an excellent one to be a part of. I find it extremely encouraging and many are willing to help if they see that you are working hard.

It is still working to think like a computer…logically. However, I am getting better and better at this and those times when I am explaining a concept, I am often shocked at the comprehension that I have. Every once in awhile, I  get to see that the things I am learning have “sunk in."
