When BuildFire added the custom widget, I was pretty surprised. It allowed for a lot of added functionality and brought the possibility of many other ways to utilize platform built apps.

Why spend the money for a fully built native app, when all you need is an added tweak?

Surprisingly, few have used it at all. Congratulations on being some of the few that are looking to implement additional features!

A great starting place is to watch the video that BuildFire's CTO did on the custom widget.

It can be found on BuildFire's Documentation: [docs.buildfire.com/custom](docs.buildfire.com/custom)

Good luck!
